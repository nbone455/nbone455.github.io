# About Nic Bone

Hello! I'm currently a PhD student in the [Uyeda lab](https://www.uyedalab.com/people.html) at Virginia Tech within the Department of Biological Sciences. I started in Fall 2019 (good timing, eh?). I work on/with/sometimes against [phylogenetic comparative methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_comparative_methods).

Before I was a PhD student I was an undergraduate at [Beloit College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloit_College), a tiny liberal arts college in Wisconsin. There I started a three year research project trying to find [convergence](https://peabody.yale.edu/exhibits/tree-of-life/convergent-evolution-recurrence-form) of body size in two lizard clades (*Lioleamus* and *Sceloporus*) with [Jim Schulte](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvHv7NwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). During this project I was introduced to the joys of phylogenetic comparative methods, and also their outstanding problems. 

Before that, I was a nerd who liked birding (mainly hawks and owls), making music and trying to figure out how to [port-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) so I could run my own Minecraft server. The hours of troubleshooting prepared me well for being a PhD student in a computational lab...

My work now focuses on helping comparative biology answer more interesting questions by improving our methodology. This usually means making our computational methods match our biological assumptions and observations in order to get to the **causes** of macroevolutionary change. Basically, making our statistics answer the questions we actually want to answer.

For my dissertation I am attempting to do this for the problem of avian migration. I'll talk about this more later!
