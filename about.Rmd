# About Nic Bone

I'm a PhD student in the [Uyeda lab](https://www.uyedalab.com/people.html) at Virginia Tech within the Department of Biological Sciences (specifically evolutionary biology). I started in Fall 2019 (good timing, eh?). Currently I am a [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and [Interfaces of Global Change](https://www.globalchange.vt.edu/igc/) fellow. I work on/with/sometimes against [phylogenetic comparative methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_comparative_methods). 

Before I was a PhD student I was an undergraduate at [Beloit College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloit_College), a tiny liberal arts college in Wisconsin. After taking an Evolution class and being exposed to phylogenies and crazy [landscapes of differential fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape), I was hooked and became a biology major. I kept bugging my professor ([Jim Schulte](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvHv7NwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)) with questions which eventually resulted in a three year research project trying to find [convergence](https://peabody.yale.edu/exhibits/tree-of-life/convergent-evolution-recurrence-form) of body size in two lizard clades (*Lioleamus* and *Sceloporus*). During this project I was introduced to the joys of trying to use phylogenetic comparative methods, and then also realized comparative methods have tons of unsolved problems.

Even before that, I was a nerdy kid who liked birding (mainly hawks and owls), making music and trying to figure out how to [port-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) so I could run my own Minecraft server. The hours of troubleshooting prepared me well for being a PhD student in a computational lab...

My work now focuses on helping comparative biology answer more interesting questions by improving our methodology. This usually means making our computational methods match our biological assumptions and observations in order to get (at least closer) to the causes of macroevolutionary (large-scale) change. For instance, hard-to-encode traits (traits that don't have easily quantifiable states, like behaviors) may evolve in ways which break our normal models of trait evolution, and yet we still sometimes ignore this mismatch. If we want to answer questions like 'is the evolution of trait A caused by a change in trait B', having a matching map (model) and territory (biological reality) will help (see a much better description of this solution -- phylogenetic natural history -- [here](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/67/6/1091/4985805)). These big issues are the kinds of things I'm interested in. 

For my dissertation, I am attempting to represent one hard-to-encode trait, avian migration, using [structured hidden Markov models](research.html).
