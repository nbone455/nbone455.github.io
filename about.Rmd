# About Nic Bone

Hello! I'm currently a PhD student in the [Uyeda lab](https://www.uyedalab.com/people.html) at Virginia Tech. I started in Fall 2019 (good timing eh?).

Before I was a PhD student I was an undergraduate at [Beloit College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloit_College), a tiny liberal arts college in Wisconsin. There I had the luck of taking an Evolution class which sparked a three year research project trying to find [convergence](https://peabody.yale.edu/exhibits/tree-of-life/convergent-evolution-recurrence-form) in lizard (*Lioleamus* and *Sceloporus*) body size with [Jim Schulte](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvHv7NwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). During this project I was introduced to the joys of phylogenetic comparative methods.

Before that, I was a nerd who liked birding (mainly hawks and owls), making music and trying to figure out how to [port-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) so I could run my own Minecraft server. The hours of troubleshooting prepared me well for being a PhD student in a computational lab...

My work now focuses on helping comparative biology answer more interesting questions by improving our methodology. This usually means making our computational methods match our biological assumptions and observations in order to get to the **causes** of macroevolutionary change. Basically, making our statistics answer the questions we actually want to answer.

For my dissertation I am attempting to do this for the problem of avian migration. I'll talk about this more later!

# About my interests (in progress)

Since I'm a massive nerd I have a lot of unconnected interests. Unsurprisingly I spend a lot of time researching these interests (a PhD student who does research? what??)


### Phylogenetic Comparative Methods 

People much better at both method development and words have written a lot about this field, so here's some good (and free) resources! 

* Luke Harmon's book: https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/chapters/

* Rosana Zenil-Ferguson's website: https://roszenil.github.io/portfolio/

* Liam Revell's website: http://blog.phytools.org/


### Philosophy 
Here are some thinkers that are interesting to me. 

* [Massimo Pigliucci](https://massimopigliucci.com/), yes okay he's an Evolutionary biologist but I am putting him here purely for his Stoic stuff, and increasingly interesting [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MassimoPigliucci)

* [Joscha Bach](http://bach.ai/) AI researcher with a good reading on the pulse of AGI or artificial general intelligence. His stance on addresses all of Western thought up until this point, which is impressive. Website is a bit outdated, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3K5UxWRRuY) is a good place to start.

* [Bernardo Kastrup](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/) A rare double PhD in Computer Science and Philosophy, one of the strongest (and only) modern-day proponents of [Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism) specifically a form where there is nothing but mind. Great debater.

* [Robert LaFleur](http://robert-lafleur.blogspot.com/) Cultural Anthropology & History, has a never-ending interpretation of the Lunar Calendar complete with translation from Chinese to English in addition to many interesting deep-dives on cultural phenomenon
