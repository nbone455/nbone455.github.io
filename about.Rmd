# About Nic Bone

Hello! I'm currently a PhD student in the [Uyeda lab](https://www.uyedalab.com/people.html) at Virginia Tech. I started in Fall 2019 (good timing eh?).

Before I was a PhD student I was an undergraduate at [Beloit College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloit_College), a tiny liberal arts college in Wisconsin. Before that, I was a nerd who liked birding (mainly hawks and owls), and trying to figure out how to [port-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) so I could run my own Minecraft server. In terms of the amount of time I spent trouble-shooting, this was basically equivalent to being a PhD student in a computational lab...

My work now focuses on helping comparative biology answer more interesting questions by improving our methodology. This usually means making our computational methods match our biological assumptions and observations in order to get to the **causes** of macroevolutionary change. Basically, making our statistics answer the questions we actually want to answer.

For my dissertation I am attempting to do this for the problem of avian migration. I'll talk about this more later!

# About my interests (in progress)

Since I'm a massive nerd I have a lot of unconnected interests. Unsurprisingly I spend a lot of time researching these interests (a PhD student who does research? what??)


### Phylogenetic Comparative Methods 

People much better at both method development and words have written a lot about this field, so here's some good (and free) resources! 

* Luke Harmon's book: https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/chapters/

* Liam Revell's website (do you need an "L" name to work in this field?):
http://blog.phytools.org/


### Interesting thinkers and thoughts

Here are some people that are intellectually interesting to me.

* [Massimo Pigliucci](https://massimopigliucci.com/), but purely for his Stoic stuff, and increasingly interesting [interview series](https://www.youtube.com/user/MassimoPigliucci)

* [Joscha Bach](http://bach.ai/) AI researcher with a good reading on the state of AGI or general artificial intelligence. Website is a bit outdated, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3K5UxWRRuY) is a good place to start.

* [Bernardo Kastrup](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/) A rare double PhD in Computer Science and Philosophy, one of the strongest (and only) modern-day proponents of [Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism) specifically a form where there is nothing but mind. Great debater.

* [Robert LaFleur](http://robert-lafleur.blogspot.com/) Cultural Anthropology & History, has a never-ending interpretation of the Lunar Calendar complete with translation from Chinese to English in addition to many interesting deep-dives on cultural phenomenon
