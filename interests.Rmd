Since I'm a massive nerd I have a lot of interests. The following section is going to be like when a person "info-dumps" on you at a party because you accidentally said the right word or phrase (e.g. 'the civil war was about ...' or 'what's your favorite band?'). Since this is my website, and therefore my party, I will proceed with the info-dump:

### Music, Audio engineering 

It's easy to record good-sounding music (don't listen to people who tell you otherwise!). I think everyone should at least try it, so I collected some basic suggestions and recommendations.

* You can use basically free, open-source software to record good-sounding music: [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and [Ardour](https://ardour.org/)

* I use [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) to download samples from youtube and remix them into beats/remixes

* For recording acoustic instruments or voices, you'll usually want a compressor microphone, which requires something called 'phantom power' (it's just a small electrical charge). The best way to do this (cheaply) is to get something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2500x-USB-Condenser-Microphone-ATR/dp/B07ZPC2FMQ/ref=pd_lpo_267_t_2/141-7695160-3538928?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07ZPC2FMQ&pd_rd_r=d24b545a-d0d5-4c69-8d7e-a287bb0467dc&pd_rd_w=xvZ9L&pd_rd_wg=n4Hgp&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=0QZECGNG0YQMWCZC27HN&psc=1&refRID=0QZECGNG0YQMWCZC27HN) although there are plenty of other options.

* W.I.P

### Phylogenetic Comparative Methods 

People much better at both method development and words have written a lot about this field, so here's some good (and free) resources! 

* Luke Harmon's book: https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/chapters/

* Rosana Zenil-Ferguson's website: https://roszenil.github.io/portfolio/

* Liam Revell's website: http://blog.phytools.org/

### Philosophy

#### Books 

Books I've read in the last couple years that have made a substantial impact on how I thought about whatever subject 

* [The Book of Why](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie

* [Red White and Black](https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-white-and-black) by Frank B. Wilderson III

* [Rationality for mortals](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-04868-000) by Gerd Gigerenzer

* [Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wf4d45) by Peter Turchin **an evolutionary biologist!**

* [Psychopolitics](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557122/psychopolitics-by-byung-chul-han/) by Byung-Chul Han

* [The Denial of Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death) by Ernest Becker **this book ruined my sophomore year of college**

* more to come as I remember and read more 


#### Thinkers
Here are some philosophical thinkers that are interesting to me. 

* [Massimo Pigliucci](https://massimopigliucci.com/) Yes, okay, he's an evolutionary biologist but I am putting him here purely for his Stoicism stuff, and increasingly interesting [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MassimoPigliucci)

* [Joscha Bach](http://bach.ai/) AI researcher with a good reading on the pulse of AGI or artificial general intelligence. His philosophical stance addresses all of Western thought up until this point, which is impressive. Website is a bit outdated, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3K5UxWRRuY) is a good place to start. 

* [Bernardo Kastrup](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/)  PhD in both Computer Science and Philosophy, one of the strongest (and only) modern-day proponents of [Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism) specifically a form where there is nothing but mind. Great debater.

* [Peter Turchin](http://peterturchin.com/) an evolutionary biologist who tries to study how societies evolve. Lots of cool stuff on his website and books.

* [Robert LaFleur](http://robert-lafleur.blogspot.com/) Cultural Anthropology & History, teaches at Beloit!, has a never-ending interpretation of the Lunar Calendar complete with translation from Chinese to English in addition to many interesting deep-dives on cultural phenomenon.

### Open-source software

* vim + pandoc + RMarkdown is amazing for creating documents (my vim [config](https://github.com/nbone455/personal-config))
