Since I'm a massive nerd I have a lot of interests. The following section is going to be like when a person "info-dumps" on you at a party because you accidentally said the right word or phrase (e.g. 'the civil war was about ...' or 'what's your favorite band?") But since this is my website, I will not feel guilty, so enjoy if you want and ignore if you don't!

* Han Shan 


* The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker

* [Robert LaFleur](http://robert-lafleur.blogspot.com/) Cultural Anthropology & History, teaches at Beloit!, has a never-ending interpretation of the Lunar Calendar complete with translation from Chinese to English in addition to many interesting deep-dives on cultural phenomenon
