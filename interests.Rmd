The following section is going to be like when a person "info-dumps" on you at a party because you accidentally said the right word or phrase (e.g. 'the Civil War was actually about ...' or 'what's your favorite band?'). Since this is my website, and therefore my party, I will proceed with the info-dump:


### Music 

Outside of science, music is my biggest interest. I spend a lot of my free time making, remixing, collecting or listening to music. 

#### Genres I like 

* math rock, specifically melodic stuff like this

  - [Elephant Gym -- Finger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bikIdnMf2gs)
  
  - [Chon -- Sleepy Tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pdfn4KmPk4)
  
  - [Chinese Football -- Electronic Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2goYUJpq9k)
  
* old funk (**I started learning the bass at 13 to try to play Jackson 5 songs**)

  - [Sly & The Family Stone -- Ha Ha, Hee Hee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0GjKyAEePk)
  
  - [Herbie Hancock -- Gentle Thoughts ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgowvFGzIvA)
  
  - [Billy Preston -- outa-space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQaS9kJc-O4)
  
* new funk?

  - [Anderson Paak -- Cheers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z58W1-uGio)
  
  - [Khruangbin -- Evan Finds the Third Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YkmBaoKBS0)
  
  - [Cory Henry -- Think for Yourself (cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9JUr4JTuJo) **this guy was a child prodigy on gospel organ, insane talent**
  
* afrobeats
  
  - [Joeboy -- Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUSnoIpevMM)
  
  - [Iyanya -- Ijeoma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-r9_jpXtPw)
  
  - [Burna Boy -- On the Low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFsskuvj8GQ)
  
#### Recording / Audio engineering 

It's easy to record good-sounding music (don't listen to people who tell you otherwise!). I think everyone should at least try it, so I collected some basic suggestions and recommendations from my experience

* You can use basically free, open-source software to record: [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and [Ardour](https://ardour.org/). There are lots of tutorials (like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQM12Rx0Hf0)), but you can usually figure out what you need from the manual + googling. If you're not an open-source snob (or you're loaded) you can use [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) or [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/)

* I use [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) to download samples from youtube and remix them into beats/remixes. 

* For recording acoustic instruments or vocals straight to your computer, you'llwant a compressor microphone which traditionally needs 'phantom power' from an audio-interface. The best way to do get around this (cheaply) is to get something like [this mic](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2500x-USB-Condenser-Microphone-ATR/dp/B07ZPC2FMQ/ref=pd_lpo_267_t_2/141-7695160-3538928?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07ZPC2FMQ&pd_rd_r=d24b545a-d0d5-4c69-8d7e-a287bb0467dc&pd_rd_w=xvZ9L&pd_rd_wg=n4Hgp&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=0QZECGNG0YQMWCZC27HN&psc=1&refRID=0QZECGNG0YQMWCZC27HN) although there are plenty of other options.

* I skip the above by using an audio interface ([Scarlett Solo](https://focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-solo)) to plug my microphones/instruments into.

### Phylogenetic Comparative Methods 

People much better at both method development and words have written a lot about this field, so here's some good (and free) resources! 

* Luke Harmon's book: https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/chapters/

* Rosana Zenil-Ferguson's website: https://roszenil.github.io/portfolio/

* Liam Revell's website: http://blog.phytools.org/

* Brian O'Meara's website: http://brianomeara.info/ **this website really has it all**

### Philosophy & History
Growing up I had the privilege of regularly going to both the Milwaukee Public Museum and the Field Museum in Chicago (my parents moved from Chicago to Milwaukee back to Chicago when I still young) resulting in me becoming an obnoxious 'dinosaur kid' fascinated with the past. My interest in history and eventually philosophy is probably what ultimately led me to evolutionary biology rather than something else, and I still find (some) time to read up on these interests.

#### Books 

Books I've read in the last couple years that have made a substantial impact on how I thought about whatever subject:

* [The Book of Why](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie

* [Red White and Black](https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-white-and-black) by Frank B. Wilderson III

* [Rationality for mortals](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-04868-000) by Gerd Gigerenzer

* [Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wf4d45) by Peter Turchin **an evolutionary biologist!**

* [Psychopolitics](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557122/psychopolitics-by-byung-chul-han/) by Byung-Chul Han

* [The Denial of Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death) by Ernest Becker **this book ruined my sophomore year of college**

#### Thinkers (Living)
Here are some living philosophical thinkers that are interesting to me. 

* [Joscha Bach](http://bach.ai/) AI researcher with a focus on AGI or artificial general intelligence. His philosophical stance (based around a computational explanation for consciousness) addresses a lot of Western philosophy up until this point in a scientific framework, which is impressive. Website is a bit outdated, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3K5UxWRRuY) is a good place to start. 

* [Bernardo Kastrup](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/) PhD in both Computer Science and Philosophy, one of the strongest (and only) modern-day proponents of [Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism). Very interesting guy, great debater, intellectually a 'mirror' to Bach (consciousness and thus reality as computation vs consciousness as reality).

* [Peter Turchin](http://peterturchin.com/) an evolutionary biologist who tries to study how societies evolve. Not sure he would consider himself a philosopher. Lots of cool stuff on his website and books.

* [David Chapman](https://meaningness.com/) another AI researcher turned philosopher, attempts to solve the ["meaning crisis"](https://awakeningfromthemeaningcrisis.com/) (coined by John Vervaeke -- another interesting thinker). Very commendable (if not too dense) on-line book, 10/10 would recommend. Claims he "isn't a philosopher".

* [Donald Hoffman](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/) Cognitive scientist who studies visual systems and works on the consciousness 'problem'. Uses evolutionary theory to hypothesize conscious subjects don't see 'real' reality, just whatever gives the best fitness -- like a virtual reality. Very interesting ideas that seem testable with evolutionary models.

* [Robert LaFleur](http://robert-lafleur.blogspot.com/) Cultural Anthropology & History, **teaches at Beloit!**, has a never-ending interpretation of the Lunar Calendar complete with translation from Chinese to English in addition to many interesting deep-dives on cultural phenomenon.

* more to add

#### Thinkers (not-living) 

* [Erwin Schr√∂dinger, specifically his lectures on the basis of life 'What is Life?'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F) Famous quantum physicist, might know about the whole cat thing. Gave a series of lectures in 1944 on how life exists from first principles, and the resulting philosophy predicted a crystalline structure that transmits information through generations (hmm wonder what that could be). 

* [Han-Shan (Cold Mountain)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanshan_(poet)) One of the many mountain recluses in the Chinese Buddhist/Daoist tradition, has some beautiful poems (some originally written on rocks, cliff-faces).

* [Diogenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes) a Greek philosopher who spent his days in a barrel. His only possession was a wooden bowl which he drank from. When he saw kids drinking directly from the river, he threw his bowl away. Founded the 'Cynic" philosophy, which is about being in harmony with nature/the state of things. Interesting guy.


### Open-source software

* vim + pandoc + RMarkdown is amazing for creating documents (my vim [config](https://github.com/nbone455/personal-config))

* I like [ranger](https://ranger.github.io/) cause I have gotten used to vim. If you don't like vim you won't like this. Apparently [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) is similar but faster (ranger is a lil bit slow)

* huge repository of minimal software (https://suckless.org/)
