Since I'm a massive nerd I have a lot of interests. The following section is going to be like when a person "info-dumps" on you at a party because you accidentally said the right word or phrase (e.g. 'the civil war was about ...' or 'what's your favorite band?") But since this is my website, I will not feel guilty, so enjoy if you want and ignore if you don't!

### Music, Audio engineering 

It's easy to record good-sounding music (don't listen to people who tell you otherwise!). I think everyone should at least try it, so I collected some basic suggestions and recommendations.

* You can use basically free, open-source software to record good-sounding music: [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and [Ardour](https://ardour.org/)

* I use [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) to download samples from youtube and remix them into beats/remixes

* For recording acoustic instruments or voices, you'll usually want a compressor microphone, which requires something called 'phantom power' (it's just a small electrical charge). The best way to do this (cheaply) is to get something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2500x-USB-Condenser-Microphone-ATR/dp/B07ZPC2FMQ/ref=pd_lpo_267_t_2/141-7695160-3538928?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07ZPC2FMQ&pd_rd_r=d24b545a-d0d5-4c69-8d7e-a287bb0467dc&pd_rd_w=xvZ9L&pd_rd_wg=n4Hgp&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=0QZECGNG0YQMWCZC27HN&psc=1&refRID=0QZECGNG0YQMWCZC27HN) although there are plenty of other options.

* W.I.P

### Phylogenetic Comparative Methods 

People much better at both method development and words have written a lot about this field, so here's some good (and free) resources! 

* Luke Harmon's book: https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/chapters/

* Rosana Zenil-Ferguson's website: https://roszenil.github.io/portfolio/

* Liam Revell's website: http://blog.phytools.org/

### Philosophy

<br>

#### Books 

Books I've read in the last couple years that have made a substantial impact on how I thought about whatever subject. 

* The Book of Why by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie

* Red White and Black by Frank B. Wilderson III

* Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall by Peter Turchin

* Psychopolitics by Byung-Chul Han

* Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher

* The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker


#### Thinkers
Here are some thinkers that are interesting to me. 

* [Massimo Pigliucci](https://massimopigliucci.com/), yes okay he's an Evolutionary biologist but I am putting him here purely for his Stoic stuff, and increasingly interesting [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MassimoPigliucci)

* [Joscha Bach](http://bach.ai/) AI researcher with a good reading on the pulse of AGI or artificial general intelligence. His philosophical stance addresses all of Western thought up until this point, which is impressive. Website is a bit outdated, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3K5UxWRRuY) is a good place to start. 

* [Bernardo Kastrup](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/) A rare double PhD in Computer Science and Philosophy, one of the strongest (and only) modern-day proponents of [Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism) specifically a form where there is nothing but mind. Great debater.

* [Robert LaFleur](http://robert-lafleur.blogspot.com/) Cultural Anthropology & History, teaches at Beloit!, has a never-ending interpretation of the Lunar Calendar complete with translation from Chinese to English in addition to many interesting deep-dives on cultural phenomenon.

### Open-source software

* vim + pandoc + RMarkdown is amazing for creating documents (my vim [config](https://github.com/nbone455/personal-config))
